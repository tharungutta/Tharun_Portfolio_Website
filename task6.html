The backwaters are also home to various wildlife, including birds, fish, and reptiles.Another popular attraction in Kerala is its beaches. The state has a long coastline, and its beaches are known for their beauty. Some of the most popular beaches in Kerala include Kovalam, Varkala, and Marari. Visitors can enjoy swimming, sunbathing, and surfing on these beaches, or simply relax and soak up the stunning views.Kerala is also home to several hill stations, which are perfect for those looking for a break from the heat and humidity of the coast. Munnar, Wayanad, and Thekkady are among the most popular hill stations in Kerala, and they offer breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and valleys.
